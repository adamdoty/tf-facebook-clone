## Description
This was an exercise for practicing building sites with HTML and CSS. I attempted to use [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology in my CSS classes but I think it need significant refactoring to conform to actual BEM.

## Other Details
This project was approached using tutorial fade methodology suggested by Josh Comeau in this [blog post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/)
