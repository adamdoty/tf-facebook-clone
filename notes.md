# Notes

## To Do

1. Responsive Design
2. Refactor CSS BEM

## Issues

1. Sidenav users icon should be colored white with a blue background
2. Stories - how to make the overlay and hover overlay on each story
3. Post Images - off center and responsiveness could use some tweaking
4. Missing left panel copyright text

## Questions

- What is the best way to space out header sections?
- Am I using BEM correctly? Sometimes there seem to be absurdly long element sections.
